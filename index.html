      <h2 class="subheading">Summary</h2>
      <p>
        I graduated from the University of Essex, Colchester, in BSc Computer Science with a first class honours.
        I'm currently a Software Engineer at Ocado Logistics (formly part of Ocado Technology) and deal mainly with control systems for the Ocado warehouse in Dordon.
        I'm now enlisted in a Udemy to learn about full stack development to improve my ability to undertake more side projects outside of work, which I hope can provide some real world value to me and/or my friends.
